        briefDescription: "Any student from the age of 12 on up is familiar with homework assignments – those rather short assignments that are assigned one day and due the next. And as those students get older, they become familiarised with long-range assignments – projects, research essays, lab reports, presentations, term papers, and, of course, the never-ending quizzes and tests to study for. Many students get to the point where they feel that all they do is attend classes and complete assignments.",
