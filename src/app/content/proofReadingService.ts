        briefDescription: "While every word processing program comes with a spelling and grammar checker they are hardly the match for all of the myriad, intricate mistakes that human beings are capable of creating. If you are submitting essays, coursework or even your dissertation without having them looked over by a professional proofreader then you are wasting your chances.",

        firstdescription: ["A normal proofreader is going to be of little to no help with an academic essay unless they happen to have a degree in the same subject that you are studying. There are technical terms and jargon unique to each field of study that a proofreader will have no understanding of. What a lucky coincidence that all of our proofreaders are drawn from a pool of educators and graduates from the very same Universities that you are trying to pass.",
                            "Little mistakes slip past everyone when they are writing, especially when they are writing something as dense and complex as a dissertation or an academic essay. Only having a human being look over your work can guarantee that all of those mistakes are eliminated. When the person who is looking for your work also happens to know exactly how essays and dissertations are graded, that can only be a little extra advantage.",
                            "Our highly trained team of experts will ensure that your work is free from spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and punctuation problems. They will also provide you with an estimate of the grade that your essay is likely to receive in its current form, explanations of why it will receive that grade and some helpful tips on how to improve your grade. The flow and structure of the work will be reviewed and revisions suggested. Your referencing and bibliography will be double checked to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. Any material that could be added to improve your grade will be suggested and everything will be run through a free plagiarism scan to ensure that there is no potential for problems after the work has been handed in.",
                            "In addition to all of the improvements that the team will make through their proofreading efforts, a full critique of your work can be included to allow you to address any issues that you might have in defending your dissertation or essay from your fellow academics. By eliminating any logical inconsistencies you can ensure that your essay is ready to face scrutiny.",
