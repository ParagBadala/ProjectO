        briefDescription: "If you have put all the work into creating an essay then you have wasted that effort if you decide not to have it edited. The difference between an essay that has been fact checked and edited and one that has not can be the difference between a passing grade and failure.",

        firstdescription: ["We understand that errors will creep into your work no matter how good you are at writing. What you might not realise is that the person who wrote a piece of work is the worst person to edit it. The current pattern of the essay that they believe is correct is ingrained in their mind and the mistakes that they made the first time through will just keep on slipping past their internal censors. You should always have someone look over your work, but in academia, it can be difficult to find someone with the necessary specialised knowledge to point out technical problems rather than just simple typos.",
