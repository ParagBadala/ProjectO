        briefDescription: "Many students do not place much importance on the college admissions essay. They believe that their other credentials are far more important – their grades, their college admissions test scores, involvement in activities, both at school and in the community, and leadership positions. You have done everything right, so of course, you will be admitted.",

Their grades are as good as yours; so are their test scores, and they have activities and leadership positions too. So, how will the admissions decision-makers actually make those decisions? Often, they will look to the essays that have been submitted with the application materials, and those essays can very well make the difference. No student can afford to “blow off” this critical piece of writing. It must be engaging, motivational, creative, and perfectly written. For this reason, many students look to an admissions essay writing service for assistance.
